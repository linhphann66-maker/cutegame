/**
 * The garden helper's rules, pure and testable (the view, helper-view.ts, only walks and poses).
 *
 * - Bought once for ϟ1000 from the garden bed panel; it lives at home.
 * - Harvest goes through M.harvest, exactly as the player's own: the crop goes to the bag, the crop's XP is earned and
 *   the harvest counts for quests. XP applies because the helper only saves the walk: every crop it gathers is one the
 *   player planted (or it replanted from the player's own seeds), so withholding XP would make buying it a penalty.
 * - Replanting uses only what is in the bag: crops without a seed item are free (as for the player); seed crops take a
 *   seed from the bag. It never buys seeds.
 * - Which crop: the chosen seed in the settings, or ("same as before") the crop last planted in that bed, otherwise
 *   the cheapest crop the player can plant (free crops first, then the cheapest seed; ties go to the higher-level crop).
 * - It plants only while auto-planting is on, and a bed the player planted by hand keeps the player's crop (fruit
 *   trees too): auto-plant.ts has that rule, shared with Sprout.
