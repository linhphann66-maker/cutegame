/**
 * Rescued friends grow up: half the explorer's height when freed, then 0.75, then 0.8 (never taller than the explorer,
 * so the explorer still reads as the hero). A stage is reached by EITHER time at home OR work done, whichever comes first:
 * - time (1 day, then 3 days after the rescue) so a player who checks in daily sees them grow even on a slow farm;
 * - jobs (40, then 150) so a busy session is rewarded. Only harvests and collects count (planting and feeding are
 *   cheap repeats), and at most GROWTH_JOBS_PER_DAY (60) a day (friends.ts tally): a busy first day reaches the first
 *   step before the day is out, and steady work the last one in 2.5 days instead of 3. (At 30 a day the jobs path took
 *   2 and 5 days, so time always won and the work never counted.)
 * Stages are saved (`grown`) and never go back, so a friend that grew stays grown after a reset of the day counter.
