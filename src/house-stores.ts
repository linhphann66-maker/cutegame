/**
 * The cottage's own "stores". Inside, the stove, workbench, globe, wardrobe and mirror open the same panels as the
 * village buildings (cooking, crafting, the starship's route map, the bag, the Look shop), and they used to open
 * them word for word: the stove said "VOLCANO KITCHEN", the globe "Starship Sprout" with a launch button, the
 * wardrobe was the whole backpack. Players read that as the outdoor shops leaking into the house. Each indoor
 * place now has its own title, icon and a purpose line saying what it is for and where the outdoor version is;
 * main.ts openDialog applies this only while the explorer is inside.
